    <h1> ABOUT ME </h1> 
<p> Hello! My name is Sergio Almonte and i am very excited to tell you all about myself. <br> I am a 14 year old (soon to be 15) who goes to Abraham Lincoln High School. </br> I love videogames (particularly Destiny 1 and 2) and am a avid Warhammer 40k enthusiast. I love to play with the Space marines and Genestealer cults.</p>

</ul> 
<p> I am a frequent volunteer at the San Francisco zoo, where i help with re-habilitation of Mountain lake, and during the summer, i help deal with all of the snotty nosed kids who need supervising. I'm going three years strong and i have no plans to stop anytime soon! </p>

<h2> My Short Poem. </h2> 
<p> Wherever they run,
  <br> wherever they fly
</br> my love for them will never die. 
<p> If my will ever falters,
  <br> or my bones ever break, 
</br> my hope will never end, 
<br> and my love will never flake. </br>
<p> <i> the end. </i>
